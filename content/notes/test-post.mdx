# Testing Email Notifications

This is a **test blog post** to verify that the email notification system is working correctly! 🎉

## What This Tests

When you publish this post (move it from `draft_content` to the main `notes` folder), the GitHub Actions workflow should:

1. ✅ Detect the new `.mdx` file
2. ✅ Parse the frontmatter (title, description, date)
3. ✅ Query Supabase for active subscribers
4. ✅ Send beautiful HTML emails to all subscribers
5. ✅ Include a "Read Full Post" button linking to your blog

## Features Being Tested

- HTML email template rendering

## Next Steps

If you receive an email with this blog post, everything is working perfectly! 🚀
